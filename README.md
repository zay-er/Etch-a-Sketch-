Most of the code was gotten from the link below, sorry if the the way the credits are done were wrong, I am still a bit new to all this.

I realized after rewriting my program using this code that I forgot to push my previous solution were I managed to get the divs to create inisde the board and change color on mouse over. 

I decided to rewrite my code because I had no idea how to properly use grid and that seemed to be useful. I also didn't know how to properly implement the reset button, and the code I previously wrote was giving me a headache. 

THe only change I did from the previous code was swap the position and how the squares would get the characterstic of changing color on mouseover. The reason I did that was because my code wasn't working and I thouhgt changing that would solve it, in hindsight I think it was because my javascript <script> was positioned differently and didn't use defer.
